# PantryPal

To start the application, run `app/src/main/java/server/Server.java` to start the server and then `app/src/main/java/server/Server.java` to start the UI. Make sure both are running simulateneously, and that they are using the libraries in `app/lib/`.

To do this, open the project in VSCode and use VSCode's built-in Java runner to first run the `Server` configuration and then the `UI` configuration. All libraries should be included in the project, so no additional setup should be required.

## Tests
To run tests, simply run `./gradlew build`.
